# Introduction to Basics Linux Command 📜🐧

Hello there, fellow penguin enthusiasts! 🐧💻 Today, we are going to dive into the magical world of Linux commands! 🧙‍♂️ Let's take a stroll through the Linux terminal and learn some cool and handy commands. Get ready for the adventure! 🚀🌌

# Check Your Present Working Directory 🕵️‍♂️📂

To find out where you are in the vast Linux filesystem, use the command `pwd` (Print Working Directory). This little trick will reveal the secrets of your current location in the Linux universe! 🗺️

Command: 📜 `pwd` 📜

Just type `pwd` in the terminal, hit enter, and voilà! 🎉 The terminal will unveil your exact whereabouts.

# List All Files and Directories, Including Hidden Ones 👀📁

Curious to explore what hides in the shadows? Linux has got your back! 👀 Use the command `ls -a` (List All) to get a complete list of files and directories, even the elusive hidden ones. 😉🔍

Command: 📜 `ls -a` 📜

With a single stroke of the keyboard, you'll discover all the treasures concealed in your current directory! 🌟💎

# Create a Nested Directory A/B/C/D/E 🏗️🐢🏠

With the power of Linux, you can build a nested wonderland, starting from A, going through B, C, D, and finally reaching the epic destination E! 🏰✨

Command: 📜 `mkdir -p A/B/C/D/E` 📜

The magic word here is `-p` (Parents). It ensures that every parent directory in the path gets created if it doesn't already exist. So, no worries if some parents are missing! Linux will take care of it. 🧚‍♀️🌈
